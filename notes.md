Add background images:
    right-click, copy image address

Target class in CSS
    .class {
        height: 200px;
        width: 200px;
        background-image: url(https.....);
        background-repeat: no repeat;
        background-size: cover;  
        background-position: 0 -100px; 
    }

    "contain" means image will fit within the grid item. Cover means image will cover whole area (grid item), but may cut off bits. 
    background-position: center (or x & y values as above)

    Can also be done to show top 10 xyz.

    Put on Netlify.
